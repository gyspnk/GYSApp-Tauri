# Release readiness ledger

The rewrite is intentionally milestone-driven:

- **Preview:** typed contracts, domain ports, BFF boundary, Quiet Sanctuary
  shell, offline TB/lyrics/faith/TimGM pack, reader and hymn browser, and
  Windows Tauri compile check.
- **Beta:** chord cache/SWR, MIDI parity, PDF reader, Bible reader/search, TTS
  provider fallback, real audio backends, pericopes, and platform contract
  suites with attached evidence.
- **GA:** parity matrix critical rows are `PARITY`, canonical-vs-rewrite MIDI
  median/p95 gate is met, accessibility/performance/security reports are
  attached, and protected OAuth/signing/store prerequisites are available.

This repository currently provides Preview foundations only. It does not claim
Beta/GA parity until the remaining reports and platform artifacts exist.

`pages.yml` is the GitHub Pages Preview pipeline. `worker.yml` is deliberately
manual and no-ops unless protected `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets are present.
